Excited to embark on a new challenge! Thrilled to share that I've got an internship where I have dived into an website creation task by using HTML, CSS, Js.Created a tic-tac-toe web application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions ,created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
